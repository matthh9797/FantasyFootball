# Distribution of Goals Scored by teams in the Premier League

By creating a barplot of the frequency of numbers of goals scored in the Premier League by each team I hope 
to get an idea of the distribution of goals that team will score.

## Burnley

I start with Burnley. As Burnley have had a consistent manager throughtout their time in the Premier League with
consistently mid-table finishes their distribution will probably be with the least noise.

Here we can see over the last three seasons Burnley have most often scored 1 at home, scoring 0 as often as 2 and very rarely scoring more than 2 goals.

In terms of away goals there is a decaying distribution with 0 being the most frequent decaying to more goals.

## Bournemouth

For the same line of reasoning I expect Bournemouth to have a consistent goal distribution over their time in the Premier League.

Bournemouths distribution over the same time is skewed more to the right that Burnleys meaning it is mre likely for them to score 2, 3 or 4 goals at home.

![Bournemouth Away Distribution 2015 - 2019](C:/Users/MattH/dataScience/projects/FantasyFootball/plots/distributions/bournemouthAwayDistribution1519.png)

We can see that Bournemouth's away from home goal distrbution is similair to that of Burnleys

## Liverpool 

For teams like Liverpool and Man City it is much easier to get an idea of their goal distribution from season to season since they score a lot more goals.

![Liverpool Home Distribution 2017 - 2019](C:/Users/MattH/dataScience/projects/FantasyFootball/plots/distributions/liverpoolHomeDistribution1719.png)

Liverpool's home distribution surprised me looking uniform almost with the most frequent number of goals scored at home, 4! This shows how frequent it is for Liverpool to score lots of goals at home.

![Liverpool Away Distribution 2017 - 2019](C:/Users/MattH/dataScience/projects/FantasyFootball/plots/distributions/liverpoolAwayDistribution1719.png)

Liverpool's away distribution has a lot easier shape and impressively we can see that Liverpool most often score 2 goals away from home.

## Man City

The logic for Man City is similar to Liverpool, we can expect that their goal distribution is reasonably consistent under Pep Guardiola.
